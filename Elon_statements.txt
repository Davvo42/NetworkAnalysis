Vote for an exciting future with DonaldTrump / 
When a politician says they want to stop “misinformation”, what they really mean is that they want to stop anyone from contradicting their lies/ Starlink is working to increase Internet capacity in dense urban areas in Africa as fast as possible. Please note that there is still significant capacity outside of city centers / 
The hammer of justice is coming /
Let’s go, America /
Important for Pennsylvania / 
The Dems will tell whatever lie wins the election /
I’m doing a digital town hall on X  tonight/
 It will get far worse under a Kamala puppet regime /
Please check to make sure your mail in ballot was accepted /
We been spending most our lives livin' in an Amish paradise /
Red wave next level LFG/
Men must vote /
Yeah, it’s totally insane. The only reason to ban ID is to make voting fraud untraceable. Obviously./
Be fair to all /
How ironic that the same people on the left who say that they want to stop disinformation are also the ones pushing debunked hoaxes relentlessly /
That is how they want to run America /
Last election, I didn’t know a single independent swing voter who was voting for Trump. 
This time, I don’t know anyone who isn’t.
And one person after another has confided in me that they’re voting for Trump, but they’re afraid to say so publicly, because it will affect their friends job customers.
Crushing defeat is coming for the oppressive. big government machine represented by the Kamala puppet. /

Similar situation in the USA /
Funny that she has never said a word about Soros, who has cumulatively put a hundred times more money into elections than I have If I can figure out rocket science with SpaceX and brain surgery with Neuralink, then maybe I can figure out politics too/
They can earn double income, go on vacation, whatever they want. It’s a good deal. /
Send people links to the actual source data on X
All it takes is for people to hear 
DonaldTrump’s actual speeches or to see a compilation of Jewish speakers at the MSG rally to start realizing how much they were lied to by legacy media./
Thanks Steve/
The number of times that the Dems have deliberately pushed this hoax a calculated lie is unconscionable/
Thanks Mom/
Congrats, Brian of Wisconsin /
Two more town halls! Anyone can join/
Live on this platform tomorrow and Tuesday/
But the legacy media says this never happens /
Whoa, this is crazy /
It is unfair, even if SNL did so unintentionally, given that NBC is allowed to use public airwaves for free /
Support the right to bear arms /
Putting only one Presidential candidate on right before the election was not cool, but this is very funny/
Citizen journalism is the only way to break out of the legacy media propaganda machine. 
Send X link to your friends/
I’m this accurate CommunityNotes /
There should be no need for FOIA requests. All government data should be default public for maximum transparency /
Every year, your freedom is eroded with millions of new rules.  High time your freedom was restored /
Doesn’t that seem insanely messed up /
She wants to break the Constitution /
What it’s like if someone only watches legacy media. They aren’t just drinking the Kool-Aid, they’re swimming in it. Vital to send X links to your friends /
Power to the people /
Correct. In fact, SpaceX received only half the money that Boeing did to develop a crewed spacecraft, yet has done ALL the completed missions/
It is NOT ok for the government to barge into your home and kill your pets! What has become of the Land of the Free/
Exactly. It is easy for Cheney to send others to die while having fancy dinners in DC, but she would think very differently if on the front lines herself/
Those are their stated goals. Unless DonaldTrump wins, this will be the last election. The Dems will legalize all the illegals in swing states, so there be no more swing states. America will become a one-party, deep blue socialist state /
The government should not be allowed to barge into your house and kill your pet! That’s messed up. 
Even if it is illegal to have a pet squirrel (which it shouldn’t be), why kill PNut instead of simply releasing him into the forest! /
What it’s like living in a swing state /
This is something new for an historically deep blue city/
Pennsylvania is on track for a major Republican victory. 
The gap between 2024 and 2020 is now over 600k, which almost 10% of the entire electorate /

Legacy media election interference/

Walz is a lying /
Why is the Democratic Party so cruel /
He called me “gay” and now he wants to touch my ass /
Why citizen journalism is vastly superior to legacy media journalism /
The so-called “Secure the Border Bill” would have converted illegals to legal immigrants, legalized the illegal actions of the Biden administration and done nothing to reduce illegal immigration.  It was a wolf in sheep’s clothing.  Any given piece of legislation will do the opposite of its name /
Sounds about right.  Units of cognition and also robot seconds of use. They will be fine-grained, but very low cost/
Actually true. Worth noting that criminals vote overwhelmingly for Democrats, because they are the soft-on-crime party.  The Democratic Party is literally the party of criminals. Just a statement of fact /

The government should leave people and their animals alone /

Government overreach kidnapped an orphan squirrel and executed him /
Government overreach in action /
Highly recommend reading waitbutwhy or anything by Tim Urban.  You will learn a lot about the world, clearly explained with evidence to back it up./
The legacy media is the propaganda arm of the radical leftists, so will immediately go after anyone who merely wants centrist policies and fairness for all. 
The policy positions of my America PAC are just common sense and moderate by any reasonable definition /
All Lives Matter /
No amount of Diddy party celebrity endorsements can save Kamala /
I’m hearing this a lot /
Exactly. The reason that the public no longer trusts the legacy media is that the media has been exposed as lying too many times to count. Legacy media absolutely deserves the lack of respect and ridicule it gets. Just yesterday, the legacy media tried to claim that DonaldTrump wanted to kill Liz Cheney when what he actually said was that she would feel differently about being a warmonger if she had to fight herself, instead of sending others to die. Shameful. /
Wow, this is crazy /
Another puppet who can’t even talk without being fed the words.  The Kamala campaign has no authenticity or true empathy. /
Also, the legacy media says you’re far right if you care about the government killing pet squirrels /

Worth watching this documentary to understand the DonaldTrump /
Republican early vote now is massively ahead of where it was in 2020. 
If this trend continues, then DonaldTrump  will win (and I hope he does) /
There is nowhere to go.  This election is a verdict on civilization /
Super important to share links so people know what’s really happening /
Worth forwarding this to friends and family /
Even if everyone in music & entertainment endorses the Kamala puppet, it won’t matter.  The public sees through it. /

A lot of people still don’t believe me when I say that the Dems will do everything in their power to destroy me if they win on Nov 5th /
Thank you everyone for subscribing to X and supporting freedom of speech /
A major factor for why Ukraine was NOT overrun by Russia is the Starlink support I provided, at great risk to SpaceX cyber and physical attack by Russian military forces. Starlink is the BACKBONE of Ukrainian military communications at the front lines, because everything else has been blown up or jammed by Russia.  In the words of Zelensky and Vice PM of Ukraine confirms that I am an ally /
Congratulations, Ronald of Michigan /
The legacy media has relentlessly promoted hate and division /
This was so funny /
California needs comprehensive reform /
Vote in person in Bucks County Only 5 hours left /
Hugh Hewitt is right: there was election interference by the Democrats in Bucks County that was so serious that a judge ordered early voting to be extended several more days /
Vote for DonaldTrump if you want humanity to make it to Mars /
They should change their name to DNN – Disinformation News Network /

Congratulations, Joshua of North Carolina /
Go figure /
Every independent voter I know is voting for DonaldTrump /
We have an upside down system that makes it hard for highly talented people to come to America legally, but trivial for criminals to come here illegally. Why is easier to get in illegally as a murderer than legally as a Nobel Laureate? DonaldTrump and DOGE will fix this /
Let us know if you’ve been illegally fired for expressing your political views /
She will be fired soon /

t’s totally insane /
The 2024 Pennsylvania Republican vs Democrat vote is now over 500k better than the same day in 2020, when Biden’s victory margin was only 80k! Moreover, yesterday there were more Republican early votes than Democrat. Pennsylvania will be a decisive Republican victory /
Exactly. That is their stated goal. Every leading Democrat has said that they want expedited citizenship for illegals. That would flip every swing state to blue and America would become a one-party state, like California /
This is just the beginning. My guess is that there will be as many Starlink direct to cell phone satellites as there are for our high bandwidth terminals. As a rough rule of thumb, however, bandwidth will be 1/10th as high for phones vs a dedicated Starlink antenna (physics is the law). Still a major gamechanger. /
True.  I think DonaldTrump winning makes a big difference in humanity getting to Mars and making life multiplanetary. This might one day save life as we know it /
Appreciate the kind words /
The woke mind virus is very real and measurable /
We are investigating this /
Congratulation, Wayne of Georgia /
Well, then it should be implemented, given that we live in a democracy /
How insane is it that the Biden Harris Administration is suing states to KEEP non-citizens on their voter rolls /
Republican early votes now exceed Democrat votes in New Jersey, normally a Democrat-leaning state /
Just 2.42% to go and the prophecy will be fulfilled /
Buzz Aldrin endorses DonaldTrump He gets it /
I recommend following Catherine Herridge for sound investigative reporting on X /
Thanks for signing our petition in support of the Constitution /
Congratulations! Insane that the “Democratic” Party was suing to allow non-citizens to vote /
Trending well, but we should never be complacent.  Drag everyone you know to vote on Nov 5th /

The New York Times is a threat to our democracy /
The Republican lead in North Carolina almost doubled from yesterday! Rumor has it that the Kamala campaign is shifting resources to shore up Virginia, which means they’re worried about losing Virginia. Let’s make even the blue states red! /
Grok is great at math /
Catherine Herridge exposes government corruption /
Big upgrade to Community Notes /
Well said by BillAckman /
Vote right now and bring everyone you know /
Independent swing voters are overwhelmingly on this platform /
This is outrageous /
This is the last day you can request an absentee ballot in Pennsylvania.  Moreover, you can hand it in immediately in person, so it never touches the mail.  Please bring anyone you know to vote today /
Full episode of JoeRogan and DonaldTrump available on X. YouTube experienced some technical difficulties /
The right choice is clear as day /
Write your thoughts on X /
Try submitting x-ray, PET, MRI or other medical images to Grok for analysis. This is still early stage, but it is already quite accurate and will become extremely good.  Let us know where Grok gets it right or needs work. /
Important to send X links to friends & relatives overseas so that they know what’s really going on /

However bad the anti DonaldTrump propaganda is in the US, it is actually even crazier overseas. People in most countries still think the news is real /
The new Boeing CEO spends time in the factory and understands engineering, which are big improvements. Hopefully, he turns around a once great company /
It was a great event. So much positive energy /
I am increasingly convinced that Neuralink should prioritize making an implant that can eliminate back and neck pain. Would greatly improve people’s happiness while awake, as well as enhance quality of sleep.
Importing future voters is by far the most competent program in the Biden Harris administration /
This hoax was repeated by Kamala in the debate with Trump even though she knows it’s a hoax /

And give responsibility for streamlining legal immigration management to a competent company, as the bureaucracy is utterly broken.  It is literally easier for a serial killer to get into America than a Nobel Prize winner /
The legacy broadcast networks are using public spectrum, but act as an extension of the Democratic Party.  No more free lunch for them /
A lot people still believe the DonaldTrump Russia hoax and have no idea that the Steele Dossier was a scam funded by Hillary  campaign /
Most important message of the night is to get everyone you know to vote and vote now! There is always some chance of a work or personal emergency or some external factor on Nov 5th that prevents people from voting /
For sure.  Obviously doesn’t make sense to count known fraudulent ballots.  What the heck is going /

The extreme left wing bias of legacy media is because journalists these days are extremely left wing.  They can’t even handle their newspapers not endorsing a candidate and remaining neutral /
